                <h1 >Summary</h1>
                <p>I'm a bachelor degree graduated civil engineering student, looking to switch career into an amazing software developer.
                    I recently finished the "Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program"
                    from Udacity (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python), and introduction to JavaScript course at Redi School of Digital Integration.
                    Currently I am a Hack Your Future student.

                    <h3>Civil engineering (End of studies internship) </h3>
                    <p> Ministry of Equipment, Housing and Territorial Development
                        For my end of studies internship I got an internship within the Ministry of Equipment, Housing and Territorial Development in Tunisia, the task was to build a beam bridge in Bourada of 59m length and 7m width, and reinforcement of a 20k m road on both sides.
                        Unlike to the other two internships, for this one I took part of all the phases of design of the project.
                        The most challenging part was doing the math and calculating the different solicitations in all layouts, the resistance of the bridge against the overloads of different kinds of vehicles and finally calculating the coefficient of transverse distribution CTD following the abbacies of professor Michel Massonnet.
                        Since the bridge is over a river, I also got to do the hydraulic and the hydrological studies using a software called Argic, that we also used to do the watershed delimitation.
                        I finally wrote a 230 pages report about the project and defended my thesis in front of a Jury and graduated with a "Very good" honors and a 17/20 mark.
                        Today Boarada bridge help more than 300 driver reach their destination safely.

                    <h3>Civil engineering (Intern): STRB </h3>
                    <p> In my second internship, once again in STRB but this time the company was asked to do a beam bridge of 56m length and 7m width and its linking roads of 40km length on both sides.
                        This time, I was also part of the design phase, so we used different software such as Piste to create the roads profiles like cross and longitudinal sections and Autocade software to design the structure of the road.
                        And then we started the realisation phase, were I contributed on:

                        <li>Breaking the ground</li>
                        <li>Compaction of the soil</li>
                        <li>Pour abutments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At this point of time, my internship came to an end, but I was so interested to see this project through so I kept visiting the construction site as a visitor and got to learn even more about:</p>

                        <li>Applying the girders</li>
                        <li>Construction of the slab (roadway), pavement</li>
                        <li>Railling</li>
                        <li>Testing the bridge</li>

                    <h3>Civil engineering (Intern): STRB </h3>
                    <p>
                        I had the chance to get an internship in a private company called STRB specialised on my field of studies, civil engineering (infrastructure), I was part of a project, where the company had to reinforce a regional road located in Siliana RR18 80m length and 7m width.
                        When I started the internship, the company has been already done with the design phase, so I was only part of the realisation phase, but in an early stage.
                        I had the possibility to put all theoretical knowledge I got in class into practice, from bush cutting to earth movement (fulling/emptying), layering, compacting to watering...
                        This internship was an eye opener for me, where I had to experience the day today life of a construction worker in the public work sector.
